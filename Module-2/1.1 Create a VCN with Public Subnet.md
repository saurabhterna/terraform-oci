## Prepare for VCN Creation

Follow these steps to create a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) using Terraform in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI):

### 1. Login into OCI Cloud Shell

Login to your Oracle Cloud account and access the OCI Cloud Shell environment.

### 2. Create a Directory

In the Cloud Shell terminal, create a directory named `createvcn` using the following command:
```shell
mkdir ~/createvcn
```
### 3. Create Configuration Files
Create two files `provider.tf` and `network.tf` to define your Terraform configuration. You can either use your local machine's text editor or the OCI Cloud Editor to create these files.

#### [`provider.tf`]((Module-2/provider.tf)

#### [`network.tf`](Module-2/network.tf)


### 4. Upload Files

Upload the `provider.tf` and `network.tf` files that you've created to the `createvcn` directory in your Cloud Shell environment.

### 5. Run Terraform Commands

Navigate to the `createvcn` directory:

```shell
cd ~/createvcn
```

Initialize Terraform:

```shell
terraform init
```

Review the planned changes:

```shell
terraform plan
```

If the plan looks correct, apply the changes:

```shell
terraform apply
```

Terraform will prompt you to confirm the changes. Type "yes" and press Enter.

Always exercise caution while applying changes, especially in production environments.

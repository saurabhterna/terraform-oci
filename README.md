## Introduction

Terraform is a popular open-source tool that allows you to define and manage your infrastructure in a declarative manner. It provides a consistent and efficient way to create, modify, and destroy infrastructure components across different cloud providers, including Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

This playbook is meant to be a hands-on companion for learning Terraform in the context of OCI. It covers the basic concepts, best practices, and real-world use cases to help you become proficient in deploying and managing OCI resources using Terraform.

## Getting Started

To get started with this playbook, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/oci-terraform-playbook.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd oci-terraform-playbook
   ```

3. Set up your OCI credentials and authentication. Ensure you have the necessary IAM permissions to create and manage resources.
